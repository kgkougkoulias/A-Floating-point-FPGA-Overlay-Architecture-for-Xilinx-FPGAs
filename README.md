# An-FPGA-Overlay-Architecture-for-Xilinx-FPGAs

This work combines the work of two authors [1][2] by optimizing an architecture to be used as an FPGA overlay,
that can also be addressed as peripheral via AXI4 interfaces.

The Overlay is packaged as a peripheral that can be accessed by two AXI4 intefaces(a lite and a full). A script is provided
that will generate the Xilinx IPs for your particular device (FP units and FIFOs). 

After than you can package the resulting XCI files with the Verilog ones, which will give an 5x5 Overlay that can be programmed to
execute different DFGs.

By packaging you will be enabled to infer more than one instances of the Overlay, so the 5x5 size is not a constaint for that 
reason. Also it makes it easier to route global signals(as CLK, RST etc) that would otherwise would have been a problem with
a bigger grid size.

Programming has to be done manually at this point meaning
 - You have to draw the DFG on the 5x5 fabric
 - Program each tile by hand with the help of the C program
 - At the end you run the script, which will give the programming sequence

The Overlay is not limited to just floating point calculations, it was just used for that purpose during the work. It can be
extended to include more DSP units that can take care of integer operations.

For more details you can read the Thesis below, although this version is slightly improved as it includes BRAM FIFOs and an
FP comparator.
