In the simulation files you can find the souce code of the design along with
a module that implements the AXI protocol(the *.sv file) so you can simulate the transactions
coming from the AXI bus. This can be programmed to sent bursts of any size and
the module that implements the communication protocol responds accordingly.

Also there is an implementation for the Lite version of the protocol to control and read the
register of the overlay simulating the CPU side.
