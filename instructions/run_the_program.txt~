In the main function of the software files on the Xilinx SDK, you can choose
in the main function which algorithm to execute. There are 4 configuration already
available for matrix multiplication, convolution, kmeans and stencil kernels(mm and conv
have the same kernel).

Each algorithm has the reference original implementation forCPU and the modified 
implementation that executes the kernels with the help of the overlay.
