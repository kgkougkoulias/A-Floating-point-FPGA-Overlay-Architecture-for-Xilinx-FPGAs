Each tile contains a configuration register that programs its functionallity, for the edge tiles it
is only 32 bits. Below you can see what every parts of the register do.

[10:5] -> can be removed they are in order to support a constant
       -> this way the functionallity that is at [15:12] can be extended


[2:1]  -> must be setted to one of the input, that means same value as [6:5] or [4:3]

[0]    -> always 0

Below you can see which bitcode you can use to redirect the inputs. For example, if you want to redirect
the South input to the North output direction, you need to write "0100" to the [7:4] bits of the configuration
register.
