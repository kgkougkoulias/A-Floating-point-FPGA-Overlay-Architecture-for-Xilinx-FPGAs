You can use the script to the generate the configuration for the register to program a tile.
First you need to compile with gcc

1. Run the executable and follow the instructions to select the desired data-flow on the switch
   and the operation on the FU

2. At the end you get a hex value that programs the particular tile for the desired functionality

3. This way you create the configuration for every tile, then write them to the txt file and finally
   execute the python script

4. If you add more functionallity you need to slightly modify the conf script, but only for
   the computational part as routing remains the same
